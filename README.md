# sqlalchemy-challenge
Advanced SQL challenge using sqlalchemy(ORM) and Flask to create API.

# Background
You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area.

## Data Engineering
Here's the steps to perform the climate analysis:-

**1. Data Analysis and Exploration**
- Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database.
- Map the Two tables in the DB for Meaurements and Station Information to classes and perform data analysis.
  
**2. Precipitation Analysis**
- Using that latest date in DB, get the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the previous 12 months of data.
- Plot the date and percipitation information for data visualization and print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.
  
**3. Station Analysis**
- Calculate the total number of stations in the dataset and query to find the most-active stations.
- Design a query that calculates the lowest, highest, and average temperatures that filters on the most-active station.
- Design a query to get the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data and Plot the results as a histogram.
  
**4. Design Your Climate App**
- Create a Flask API with home page showing all the avaiable routes to retrieve the Precipitation and Station Analysis in a JSON response object format.

Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called sqlalchemy-challenge. Do not add this assignment to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for this Challenge. Use a folder name that corresponds to the Challenge, such as SurfsUp.

Note that youâ€™ll add your files to this folder and push the changes to GitHub.
